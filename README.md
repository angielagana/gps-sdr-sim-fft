# GPS Signal Analysis with FFT

This script allows you to analyze and compare two GPS baseband signal data streams by computing the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and plotting the spectrum.

## Features
- Load GPS baseband signal data from binary files
- Compute the FFT of the signal
- Plot the spectrum of the signal
- Compare spectra from multiple files on the same graph

## Requirements 
1. Python3
2. NumPy
3. Matplotlib

## Usage
Clone the repository. Install the required dependencies. Run the following command: 
> python gps_signal_analysis.py --file1 <path_to_file1> --file2 <path_to_file2>
You can analyze a single file if desired.
